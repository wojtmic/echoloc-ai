# Project Oracle (CODENAME)
Welcome to Project Oracle (**CODENAME, NOT FINAL**), destined to be a context-aware, local, AI assistant based on Google's Gemma. This project is currently in the early stages of development, and is not yet ready for public use. The project is being developed by [Wojtmic](https://wojtmic.dev) and tested by [Tymon3310](https://tymon3310.github.io).

## Core features
- Open-source
- Local
- Context-aware
- Free
- Customizable

## How to install
1. Download the latest installer for your OS from the [releases page](https://todo.wojtmic.dev/download).
2. Run the installer
2.1. On Windows, press 'Learn More' and then 'Run anyway'. This is because the installer is not signed as that may cost up to 10,000 USD per month.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen
4. Select Your GUI. This can be changed later.
5. After launching the GUI, type $start to start the daemon. After its ready, you will receive a notification.
6. Enjoy! If you have any questions, feel free to ask them on our [Discord server](https://todo.wojtmic.dev/discord).
### DISCLAIMER: You may experience significant system usage spikes while the daemon is running, especially when generating responses or starting. This is normal. The installer will notify You if Your hardware is not powerful enough to run the daemon. The daemon WILL use at least 3-5GB of RAM at any time and during generation will use as much CPU/GPU as it can.

## Recommended hardware:
- 4-core CPU
- 12GB of DDR4 RAM
- 20GB of SSD storage
- Modern operating system (Windows 10, macOS 12, Ubuntu 20.04 or any other modern Linux distribution. Will work in newer systems)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support or Apple M2 or newer chip (for a smooth experience, optional)
### This is a rough estimate. The daemon will run on less powerful hardware, but it may be slow. For an external installation, instructions can be found [here]("https://todo.wojtmic.dev/adv-install").
